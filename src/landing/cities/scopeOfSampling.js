            Surat, also known as the textile city and the diamond city, is located in the western part of India with the Tapi river flowing across. The area of the city served by the drainage network is 74% with 71.2% of the population connected to these networks. The city is divided into seven operational zones. The number of STPs and SPSs operational in these zones are 12 and 68 respectively.

            For conducting the pilot it was essential to start with a particular zone and then scale it up to other zones in the city. After discussions with the city drainage team, health team and experts, it was decided to conduct the surveillance in the â€œwest zone''. The west zone was chosen as it is covered majorly with residential spaces with a good coverage of the sewerage network, and the data of the catchment population of these sewerage points could help in quantification of the results.
During the deployment from 1st Jan, 2022, estimated up to 31st March, 2022, the samples are being collected from the west zone. Few facts about the west zone are given below:
